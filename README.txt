Pre requirenments:
-Install google drive app if its not installed already
-synchronise the excel file
-Open outlook and log in
-Close the excel file located on your computer

How to use:
From outlook
1. select the excel file you write to write into.
2. in outlook mark the emails you want to extract from as unread if they aren't already
3. press the extract from outlook button
IMPORTANT! The program might not extract all the unread emails with one press, in this case just press it again until
there are no more unread emails, that contain "FW:" in their subject bracket

From downloaded pdf
1. select the excel file you write to write into.
2. select the pdf file you want to extract from.
press the extract from pdf button.

Notes:
Always back up your files
the program ma say it has finished writing but don't believe it.
If the excel was open during extraction the program cannot write in it. This is not to be mistaken with the google drive file
so in short you can have the excel open in browser but not in excel. Hope this makes sense.
The program is very sensitive to the way the excel columns are named.
